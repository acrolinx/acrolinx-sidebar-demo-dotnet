# Acrolinx .NET Sidebar Demo

This is a showcase for integrating the [Acrolinx](https://www.acrolinx.com/) Sidebar into a .NET application.

See: [Getting Started with Custom Integrations](https://docs.acrolinx.com/customintegrations)

## Live Demo

## The Acrolinx Sidebar

The Acrolinx Sidebar is designed to show up beside the window where you edit your content.
You use it for checking, reviewing, and correcting your content.
To get an impression what the Sidebar looks like in existing integrations, have a look at
[Get Started With the Sidebar](https://docs.acrolinx.com/coreplatform/latest/en/the-sidebar).

## Prerequisites

Please contact [Acrolinx SDK support](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/sdk-support.md)
for consulting and getting your integration certified.
This sample works with a test license on an internal Acrolinx URL.
This license is only meant for demonstration and developing purposes.
Once you finished your integration, you'll have to get a license for your integration from Acrolinx.
  
Acrolinx offers different other SDKs, and examples for developing integrations.

Before you start developing your own integration, you might benefit from looking into:

* [Getting Started with Custom Integrations](https://docs.acrolinx.com/customintegrations),
* the [Guidance for the Development of Acrolinx Integrations](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance),
* the [Acrolinx SDKs](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=sdk), and
* the [Acrolinx Demo Projects](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=demo).

## Getting Started

## Run Locally

1. Make sure that you have installed Microsoft Visual Studio with C# support version 2015 or later.
2. Since the Acrolinx Sidebar performs static code analysis to improve quality,
   you also have to install [Code Contracts for .NET](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1ec7db13-3363-46c9-851f-1ce455f66970).
3. Open the solution file [`Acrolinx.Demo.Sidebar.Net.sln`](Acrolinx.Demo.Sidebar.Net.sln) with Visual Studio.
4. Run the solution.

Visual Studio downloads the required dependencies and compiles the Acrolinx .NET Sidebar Demo solution using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).

*Note: The dependency download may fail on the first build. This problem can usually be solved by building a second time.*

## Using the SDK

1. Use the [Acrolinx Sidebar .NET SDK NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Acrolinx.Sidebar/) as dependency.
2. After you resolve the Acrolinx .NET Sidebar dependency, you can start using it in your project.
   In the Designer View of your form, reference the file `Acrolinx.Sidebar.dll`
   using the "Choose Items" function of the Toolbox:
   ![Choose Items](/doc/chooseitems.png)

3. You should be able to drag and drop the Acrolinx Sidebar to your form:

   ![Toolbox](/doc/toolbox.png)

4. Usually you dock (`Properties`->`Layout`->`Dock`->`Right`) the Acrolinx Sidebar
   to the right side of your form or some child panel:

   ![Form1](/doc/form1.png)

5. Somewhere in your initialization code, tell the Sidebar to start:

   ```csharp
   acrolinxSidebar1.Start();
   ```

   ![Start Sidebar](/doc/start.png)

6. Run the application. If you see the Acrolinx Sidebar, then everything went well.

7. The next step is to implement the extraction and the events of the Sidebar:

![Events](/doc/events.png)

Have a look at the sample source code provided in the sample project.

### Configuration

To configure the Sidebar, use the properties window:

## SDK Features

1. Provides [lookup](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/text-lookup.md) functionality.
2. **Start page**: Provides interactive way to sign in to Acrolinx with built-in error handling.
3. **Logger**: Provides [logging](https://github.com/acrolinx/sidebar-sdk-dotnet/blob/master/Acrolinx.Sidebar/Util/Logging/Logger.cs)
   using Log4net.
4. **Acrolinx Storage**: Applications using the Internet Explorer web browser control may be denied to access LocalStorage.
   The SDK uses its own [storage](https://github.com/acrolinx/sidebar-sdk-dotnet/blob/master/Acrolinx.Sidebar/Storage/RegistryAcrolinxStorage.cs)
   mechanism using Windows registry:
   + **Registry path**: `HKCU\Software\Acrolinx\Plugins\Storage\[KEY]`
   + **Fallback path**: `HKLM\Software\Acrolinx\Plugins\Storage\[KEY]`
